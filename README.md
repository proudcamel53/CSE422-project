# Customer Churn Classification

A machine learning project that predicts customer churn using multiple classification algorithms and comprehensive data analysis.

## Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior to predict churn using Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network models. Includes complete data preprocessing, visualization, and model comparison.

## Dataset

- **1,502 customer records** with 9 features
- **Target**: Churn (0 = No Churn, 1 = Churn)
- **Features**: Age, Income, Gender, Marital Status, Credit Score, Purchases, Membership Years, Device Used

## Quick Start

```bash
